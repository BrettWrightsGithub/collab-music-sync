## Business Case Summary - Business Requestor

### Problem / Opportunity Description:
*What is the problem we are solving with this project? Who does it negatively impact today?*

Sharing music playlists across platforms like YouTube Music and Spotify is a frustrating and time-consuming process for users. Users who subscribe to one platform often find it difficult to engage with playlists shared by friends or others using a different service. The lack of seamless interoperability forces users to either:

- Listen on an unfamiliar platform they don’t subscribe to, often with limited access or ads, or
- Manually recreate the playlist on their preferred service, which is tedious and detracts from the joy of sharing and discovering music.

This fragmentation reduces the social and collaborative experience of enjoying music, creating a significant pain point for users across ecosystems.

### Solution Description:
*What would solve the problem/issue above?*

Reduce the number of systems to be manually updated by creating a cross-platform playlist conversion and sharing service that automates playlist transfers between streaming platforms like YouTube Music and Spotify.

## Internal Personas Impacted

| **Persona** | **Key Attributes** | **Use Case** |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------|
| **The Social Music Sharer** | - Young, socially active<br>- Tech-savvy<br>- Active on social media<br>- Values convenience<br>- Uses streaming platforms for personal and group enjoyment | Alex curates a "Road Trip Playlist" on Spotify and wants to share it with friends, some of whom use YouTube Music. Alex uses the service to quickly convert and share the playlist, ensuring everyone can access it on their preferred platform without hassles. |
| **The Collaborative Creator** | - Music enthusiast or hobbyist<br>- Enjoys co-creating and refining playlists<br>- Passionate about music curation<br>- Focused on collaboration<br>- Values precision in song selection and order | Taylor and their bandmates use separate platforms but want to build a shared playlist for inspiration. Taylor initiates the playlist on YouTube Music, and with bidirectional syncing, updates made by their bandmates on Spotify appear seamlessly. |
| **The Casual Listener with a Music Network** | - Less tech-savvy<br>- Prefers ease of use over customization<br>- Not deeply familiar with advanced tech<br>- Regularly uses streaming platforms | Jordan’s friend sends a curated holiday playlist from Apple Music, but Jordan uses Spotify. Instead of giving up or trying to recreate the playlist manually, Jordan uses the platform to convert the playlist in a few clicks, enjoying it without needing technical knowledge. |

## Goals/Objectives for Proposed Solution
*What must be true for this to be considered a success?*

- **Automate Playlist Conversion:** Utilize APIs from popular streaming platforms (e.g., YouTube Music, Spotify) to programmatically map and convert playlists between services.
- **Centralized Sharing Interface:** Develop a lightweight, user-friendly web or mobile application where users can input playlist IDs and receive a converted playlist that is compatible with their preferred service.
- **Preserve Metadata and Order:** Ensure song metadata (e.g., title, artist, album) and playlist order are maintained during the conversion to enhance the user experience.
- **Enable Bidirectional Syncing:** Implement functionality that allows playlists to remain synchronized across platforms, enabling collaborative updates from any platform to reflect on the other seamlessly.
- **Handle Edge Cases Gracefully:** Provide clear feedback for unavailable or mismatched songs, with options to suggest alternatives or leave placeholders.
- **Privacy and Security:** Protect user data through secure API integrations and clear permissions for accessing user playlists.
